Welcome to Korean Learnbook 1, the first step in our journey to learn Korean!
This part focuses entirely on the Korean alphabet (Hangeul) and helps you become familiar with its characters and pronunciation.

📁 This folder contains three files, each with a specific role:

1. 1_Hangeul_alphabet.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook that serves as a lesson.
Introduces Hangeul characters and pronunciation step by step.
Includes exercises for different character types.

2. hangeulit.py
A Streamlit web app that helps you practice recognizing and pronouncing random Hangeul characters.
You’ll be shown a character and asked to input the correct pronunciation.
The app gives immediate feedback and generates a new character after each attempt.

3. hangfunc.py
A helper module that contains all the functions used by hangeulit.py.

⚠️ Note: hangeulit.py depends on hangfunc.py, so both must be present to run the app.
