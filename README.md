# Korean-Learnbook 1

This folder is the first step of my Korean learnbook, this step is all about the Korean alphabet and getting familiar with the characters.
It contains 3 files : 

- "1 Hangeul_alphabet.ipynb" acts like a lesson to get familiar with the characters and their pronuntiation, with different steps for different types of characters
- "hangeulit" is a code to be run in order to exercise on the alphabet, it will generate a web interface using Streamlit, in which a random Hangeul will apear, the user will need to return its pronuntiation, after that it will indicate if it is correct or not and then repeat with another character
- "hangfunc" only contains functions for hangeulit to run

The notebook can be run on its own but hangeulit need hangfunc to be ran, you also need to have streamlit installed on your local environement to create the web interface

The web page can be accesed through this link : https://korean-learnbook-guguzilla.streamlit.app
